## Reproduce

```bash
source harness/sanitizer_env.sh
harness/build/toml_harness triage/reports/run_52/many_sibling_keys_a_hang_not_a_crash-unparsed_timeout/minimized.toml
echo $?   # expect 86 (sanitizer) or a signal
```

## Deduplication choices applied

- Consecutive identical frames collapsed (recursion bugs otherwise report as
  many distinct bugs depending on where the stack ran out).
- Harness frames (`toml_harness`, sanitizer runtime, libc startup) excluded;
  bucketing uses library frames only.
- Frame identity is `function file:line`; addresses and absolute paths stripped.
